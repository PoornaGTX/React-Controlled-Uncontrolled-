# Controlled and Uncontrolled Components in React

## Description
Both controlled and uncontrolled components have their use cases in React. Controlled components provide more control and are preferred for most applications due to their predictability and ease of handling complex interactions.
Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, offer simplicity and can be useful in specific scenarios where less control is needed. 
Understanding both patterns allows developers to choose the right approach based on the requirements of their applications.
